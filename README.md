Inputs declared outside of main : Character named ch ;
Inside main , two arrays was used , one named input to store charcacters up to 256 and the second one 
to count the repetitive letters entered by user under the letterCount array sized 26(sized twenty-six due to the logic of maximum alphabetical letters)
In addition to that , there was updated local variable named 'i' that was used inside the main under the loop statements 
Nested if statements were used for several purposes ; to convert the capital letters to small letters , and also to check the characters entered if letters ot not
The output was only shown on screen with a statement that facilitate the user to see when entering the characters under this expression 
"Enter text strings (press Enter on an empty line to exit" , if an enter was pressed on an empty line the , the compiler will exit the entire program 
fgets(to get the input from user) and strlen(to check if character entered is only one) are built-in functions that were used
Another output to be print on screen in order to show the counts of the same characters enetered by the user after this expression 
"Distribution of letters in the input: "
so if the user enetred a series of alphabetical letters , the compiler will show the count of all the alphabetical letters either entered or not
